# [NearAcademy]

An education website to help students to pass the national exams by providing the
latest sample tests and exercises with the support of a group of volunteered and
talent teachers. Education should be free and accessible for anyone, just like
communism.

## Development

```bash
yarn dev-server
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Use npm instead of yarn because up until now (20/11/2019)
# yarn does not support passing arguments to npm script
npm run deploy --M='commit message'
```
